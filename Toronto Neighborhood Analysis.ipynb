However, unlike New York, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet.\n\nFor the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. I will scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format.\n\nOnce the data is in a structured format, I will explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto."
